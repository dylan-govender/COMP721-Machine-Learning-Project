# COMP721-Machine-Learning-Project
Our submission for the Machine Learning project.

# Game Outcome Prediction Part 1
Game outcome prediction, Part 1, uses Ensemble Learning with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor algorithms.

# Game Outcome Prediction Part 2
Game outcome prediction, Part 2, uses Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering for clustering analysis.
- Team Performance Clustering captures a complete view of team capabilities, considering both offense and defense metrics to analyze detailed performance patterns.
- Point Difference Clustering uses the specific point_differential metric to create a straightforward winning vs. losing team distinction, which is often predictive of game outcomes when scoring is a primary performance indicator.

# Outstanding Players Outlier Detection
This notebook demonstrates an outlier detection analysis of basketball players using Isolation Forest and DBSCAN algorithms, focused on identifying exceptional performers based on offensive and defensive statistics. By reducing player performance metrics into two principal components (PC1 for offense and PC2 for defense), the models detect players who deviate significantly from typical performance clusters. The analysis identifies the top ten players by season, playoff, or All-Star performance, with visualizations of outliers in reduced dimensions. The results provide insights into players with extreme statistics and highlight the effectiveness of Isolation Forest and DBSCAN in anomaly detection within sports data.
