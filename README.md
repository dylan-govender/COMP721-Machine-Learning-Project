# COMP721-Machine-Learning-Project
Our submission for the Machine Learning project.

# Game Outcome Prediction Part 1
Game outcome prediction, Part 1, uses Ensemble Learning with Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost Regressor, and Support Vector Regressor algorithms.

# Game Outcome Prediction Part 2
Game outcome prediction, Part 2, uses Unsupervised Learning with K-Means Clustering for clustering analysis.
- Team Performance Clustering captures a complete view of team capabilities, considering both offense and defense metrics to analyze detailed performance patterns.
- Point Difference Clustering uses the specific point_differential metric to create a straightforward winning vs. losing team distinction, which is often predictive of game outcomes when scoring is a primary performance indicator.
